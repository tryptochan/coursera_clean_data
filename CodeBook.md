### Data Manipulation

The raw data was taken from [UCI HAR Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). Traning and test set were merged and only the mean and standard deviation measurements were extracted. Finally measurements were averged for each subject and each activity.
